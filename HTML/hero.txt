I'm currently a second year, studying at EPITECH Strabsourg and i strive to become the best developer possible.
I come to appreciate building beautiful and functional websites and i'm currently learning how to make them.

To better comprehend my level in the development industry,
i'll show you my qualifications and the applications / languages that i use.
I started developping about 2 years ago and the more i advance, the more i get qualifications
on multiple languages and applications:

So these are the coding-language i'm confident on (from the most to the least) :
C     bash     html     css
C++     JavaScript     Haskell     ASM

And these are the applications i can fluidly use :
Git     Github     VSCode     PPt 
Emacs     npm     Canva
    
I truly have a lot to learn and i look forward to take every bit of experience i can get.
My school is perfect for me and i will come out of EPITECH in 2027.
And so, i still have 3 years to train before getting to a 100% in the professional world, although i have stages
in my years of school.
